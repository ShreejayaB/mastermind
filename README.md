- The following working code in GitHub (3): 
    - A environment (1) 
    
    Code for Environment is in `Exploration_Env_Agent.ipynb`
    
    - An agent that performs random actions in the environment (1) 
    
    Code for Agent that performs random actions in the environment is in `Exploration_Env_Agent.ipynb`
    - An agent that learns based on the environment (1)
    
    Code for Agent that learns based on environment is in `pytorch_policy.py`
    
- List of ideas to finish project (1):

1. Implement Policy gradient method.
1. Apply Q-learning and compare with policy gradient method.
