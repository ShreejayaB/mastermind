Finalized Research Question : Can we make an RL agent play Mastermind?

List of ideas to finish project in GitHub :

- Create environment, agent
- Simulate data
- Apply policy gradient method
- Apply Q-learning and compare with policy gradient method.


- The following working code in GitHub (3): 
    - A environment (1) 
    
    Code for Environment is in `Exploration_Env_Agent.ipynb`
    
    - An agent that performs random actions in the environment (1) 
    
    Code for Agent that performs random actions in the environment is in `Exploration_Env_Agent.ipynb`
    - An agent that learns based on the environment (1)
    
    Code for Agent that learns based on environment is in `pytorch_policy.py`
